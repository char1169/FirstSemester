        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Melodie, my birthday is on April 28<sup>th</sup> and I am 19. I like gardening, cooking, drawing and learning. I graduated highschool with the highest average in design! This made me realise that design is definetly something I want to do. I love different types of design; interior design, graphic design, media design and more! </p>
        <p>This is my first year at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> and I recently moved into my first apartment this year with my cat <em>Hollow</em> I filled my apartment with plants and beautiful decor! It makes me very happy to have my own space and to be able to decorate with my own style. I love the minimal and simple look. It makes my apartment look bigger and cleaner.</p>
